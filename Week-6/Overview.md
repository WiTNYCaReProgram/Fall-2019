# Mock Job Search Instructions for Students

*Please note: Even if you do not complete these steps, everyone is expected to attend the November 20 mock interviews for the entire session.* 

## Step 1: Apply to one of our “jobs”

*Deadline: Monday, November 18*

- Select one of our three mock job descriptions to apply for, currently posted in the Week 6 folder. These are descriptions very typical of what you might see on a job site or company’s hiring website. 

- When you’ve selected a job that interests you, edit your resume and develop a cover letter appropriate for that job.

- When your resume and cover letter are ready, it’s time to “apply”! Send an appropriately-worded email to witnyteam@gmail.com as if you’re applying for the position. 

## Step 2: Arrange your interviews

- When you send your materials to witnyteam@gmail.com, within a day or so you will receive a response inviting you to interview. 

- Respond to the message appropriately and professionally, confirming and/or asking relevant questions (If you have any). All interview times will be held during the standard CaRe session times. 

## Step 3: Show up and mock interview!

- Arrive at the normal session start time on November 20, with your specific interview times and group assignments, as well as a hard copy of your resume (If you cannot bring a hard copy of your resume with you, just let us know and we can print one for you). 

- Everyone will have the opportunity to do at least one mock behavioral interview, and one mock technical interview, in a whiteboard format. Depending on volunteer numbers, there might be opportunities for more than one round of interviews.

- Come fully prepared for the interview process! The interviewers will be a mix of Cornell Tech students with interview experience and professionals from the NYC tech industry.
