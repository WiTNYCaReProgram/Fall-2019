# WiTNY Career Readiness (CaRe) Program Overview

WiTNY’s Career Readiness (CaRe) Program is our effort to prepare driven CUNY women for the tech internship and job search process, from resume writing to acing the interview process. We aim to provide a cohort-based, experiential curriculum - which means we want you to connect with other students, and learn by tackling challenges together. Check out the repository folders for each week to learn the specifics of what we’ll share with you, but know that our first priority is making sure you feel more confident and capable of navigating the tech job search, with a community of other women behind you all the way. 

We believe sharing the ‘why’ of the things we do creates a culture of valuing new and different experiences, and in that spirit, the below are our learning outcomes. “Learning outcomes” are the things we hope you will be able to do or know when we’re done with our time together this semester. 

### At the end of this program, we want you to be able to:
- Demonstrate knowledge of the main components of a job search and interview process
- Analyze your professional strengths and effectively communicate them to others
- Utilize best practices to write industry-standard resumes and cover letters, as well as LinkedIn profiles
- Communicate effectively in behavioral interviews and networking contexts, both virtually and in person
- Implement best practices and standard strategies for technical interviews in the tech industry
- Develop connections with other WiTNY CaRe participants and individuals currently working in the tech industry
- Practice effective goal setting and reflection

## Who is WiTNY?

The Women in Technology and Entrepreneurship in New York (WiTNY) program aims to propel more women into tech careers through educational programs, work opportunities, and community building. The main goal for our corporate-funded, multiyear initiative is to double the number of CUNY women graduating with degrees in computer science and related tech disciplines. We do this because we believe that closing the gender gap in tech is essential to being competitive in the digital age.

Maybe you know us from our Summer Guild program, Winternships, or other events? If so, it’s great to have you with us again. If not, we’re thrilled to meet you! 

## Weekly Schedule 

We’ll provide you with a full detailed schedule at the first session, but in the meantime, here is our general roadmap for this semester’s CaRe program:

**Week 1: Introductions, Storytelling, and Resume Building**

We’ll learn a bit about each other, give an overview to our time together this semester, and then jump right into our first session. Learn the importance and effectiveness of thinking about your story - who you are, how you got here, and what's next for you - and how you can use those components to both shape your job search and write about yourself in resumes and cover letters. 

Location: Both sessions will be held at the CUNY Graduate Center, 365 Fifth Ave.

**Week 2: LinkedIn Utilization and Effective Job Searching**

This session is about using LinkedIn to market yourself and find jobs most effectively, assisted by volunteers and facilitators. Learn how to maximize your reach with a great profile, and establish connections with others who can help you in your career journey.

Location: Afternoon (2-5PM) session will be at Grow with Google, 111 8th Avenue between West 15th and West 16th Streets; Evening (6-9PM) session will be at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, New Building CLSS Student Computer Lab Center, at 524 W. 59th St. 

**Week 3: Personal Branding for the Career**

How do we talk about ourselves and present ourselves best? Then, how do we talk to others most effectively? Starting with an assessment of how others see you and how you see yourself, we will go through building relationships and motivating your target audience for career success. We will wrap up with a discussion of imposter syndrome and how to combat it as you progress in your career.

Location: Both sessions will be held at the CUNY Central offices, 205 E 42nd St.

**Week 4: The Basics of the Behavioral Interview**

We’re going to use what we know about ourselves and what others say about us to crack the code of interviewing - from preparation before, to following up after. After reviewing how interviewing general proceeds, we’ll drill down into the mechanics of the behavioral interview.

Location: Both sessions will be held at the CUNY Graduate Center, 365 Fifth Ave.

**Week 5: Introduction to Technical Interviewing**

The Technical Interview is a unique beast, but one each of us can conquer. We’ll go through the common types of technical interview formats and questions, provide resources to help prep for the standard question types, and then work in groups to practice some problems in real time.

Location: Sessions will be held at various locations. Will be updated when confirmed. 

**Week 6: Mock Interview Process - Resume to Technical Interview**

This is our chance to show off all these skills - this session will utilize extensive pre-work to set up a mock interview day, including a behavioral interview and technical interview. We’re going to navigate through the entire process of selecting a job position to apply for, a cold email with resume and cover letter, scheduling an interview, and then showing up and making the magic happen with interviews in person during the session.

Locations: Both sessions will be held in the Tata Innovation Center at Cornell Tech, 2 West Loop Rd., Roosevelt Island
