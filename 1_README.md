# Welcome to the Fall 2019 WiTNY Career Readiness Program!

This location will be a one-stop shop for all things Career Readiness (CaRe) throughout the next coming weeks, and hopefully will continue to be a resource as you start, or continue, your job or internship search. 

We will be updating the materials in this repository as we move through the 6 weeks of the CaRe program, so make sure to watch for new information. 

At least 1 week prior to a given session, we will put up any pre-session deliverables, and if we have supplementary materials after a session that would be helpful, we will post them by the following Friday. 

## Permission for Use

This repository is intended for the Fall 2019 WiTNY Career Readiness student cohort. If you are not a member of this group but would like to utilize these materials for your own programming, please contact WiTNY at witny@cornell.edu prior to use.
