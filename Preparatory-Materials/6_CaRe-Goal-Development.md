# Goal setting in CaRe

We at WiTNY like goals, and the industry does too. Whether they’re labeled ‘goals’, ‘strategic priorities’, 
‘10 year plans’, or any of the other jargon that graces the professional sphere, they’re all the same thing - 
stating what a person or organization wants to do. 

Over the course of our time in the CaRe program, we’re going to ask you to set a larger goal 
for what you want to get out of the program, and a series of smaller goals each week to help you move toward 
that broader ‘want to do’. 

We’ve developed a worksheet below that we’d like you to complete prior to starting your CaRe program time with us. 
You can fill it out however you want - digitally via a branch, on paper, with a photo collage, literally anything - 
but we ask that you do some real thinking about what you want from your time with us. There is no correct answer, 
and the right answer is whatever is most right for you personally. 

We want to make clear that this document is a tool, and as such, 
if you’d prefer to think about your goals and track them in a way that works better for you, 
please feel free to use a method that fits with your workflow. That said, we will ask that you 
engage with the goal setting and reflective process fully, even if you’re not using our tools.


## CaRe Goal Worksheet

*This worksheet will never be turned in or required to be shared with anyone, so please be honest with yourself as you use 
this to guide your preliminary thinking about your overall goal for participating in CaRe.*

- When you first applied to the care program, what did you think you would get from the program? What made it worth 
taking the time to complete the application, go through the phone screening, and make the commitment to come to each session?


- It’s been a while since applications were submitted. Has any of your reasoning for wanting to participate changed? If so, how?


- Think about your above answers and write down a single statement of what you think you want to get from 
our CaRe program at this point. Don’t worry about formatting, or how its written, just go with it.


- If you were to magically teleport into a future where you successfully got what you wanted from your your 
CaRe experience as written above, what would that look like for you, or what would you be doing?


- What would you feel like in that moment of achievement? Why?


- What skills would you have that you don’t have now, if any?


- What knowledge would you have that you don’t have now, if any?


- Who would “be there with you”? Who would you want to share this achievement or state of being with?


Take a minute to think about your answers to the previous questions. Your overall goal is probably pretty vague, right? If you tried to create a plan to achieve it, maybe you wouldn't know where to start (Or maybe you would, but it would be a very complex plan). Now consider your answers to the questions about skills and knowledge. 

- Prioritize the skills and knowledge you would have in your imagined future. What would you want or need to achieve first? Are there any that are building blocks for others, and should be prioritized first?


- Take the first priority skill or piece of knowlege. When would you want to achieve or gain it by?


- What steps would you need to take to do it? List them out. 


- What resources (time, money, information, etc.) do you need to achieve those steps?


*This thought exercise is intended to encourage us to engage with what we really want to achieve in 
CaRe and beyond, and then break that desire down into different components we can pursue individually. For more information on why this refining process is useful, Google "SMART goals" and check it out! Goals that are SMART, or Specific, Measurable, Achieveable, Relevant, and Time-Bound have been shown to be easier to work toward.*
