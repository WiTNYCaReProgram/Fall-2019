# CaRe Course Tools

We will be using a few course tools to make communication and information sharing easier. These include Slack, 
LinkedIn, and of course, GitHub. 

## Slack

Slack is a collaboration platform that the tech and startup sectors are using extensively, and we use it as well to 
communicate with you, in addition to email. 

1) Join the WiTNY workspace (witny-cunycornell.slack.com) using the link here: TBD 

2) When you’ve successfully created your account and joined the workspace - 
   - Join our #fall2019careprogram channel
   - Find a tech-related article that is interesting to you and post it in our channel

If you’d like more information on how to use Slack, check out the Slack help center article for new members, 
(https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-members). 


## LinkedIn

LinkedIn is an incredibly valuable tool for effective networking and forging connections with other industry professionals. 
Before you start your first CaRe program session, we ask that you create a LinkedIn account (Totally free!). 

To do so, you can follow the instructions here: https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/2964/signing-up-to-join-linkedin?lang=en. 

If you have questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to any of our program staff. 
Please note, we don’t require you to fill out your profile entirely before you arrive, 
but having an active and complete profile is always better than an empty one!
