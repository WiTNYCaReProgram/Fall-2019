# Our Guiding Principles

**Get Started** - Maybe it doesn’t make sense yet or it seems silly. We have to start everything somewhere. 
Nothing will be perfect at the beginning, and we learn from what doesn’t work.

**Make Thinking Loud** - We learn more from another’s process than another’s product. Share not only conclusions, 
but the reasoning behind them. Share the ‘why’. 

**Don't Be Mean** - This is our network, here for a shared purpose. Recognize that out of the many, many different 
paths we all took here, we’re now present in a common moment, wanting to learn. Toxic behavior travels fast and negatively affects everyone. 

**Be Twice as Excited** - Moments of excitement and open positivity can feel like vulnerability. It takes greater strength to 
lean in with enthusiasm than to disengage. Give other people the opportunity to share your excitement.

**Commit to It** - Go that extra step. Make the time to prepare, and to reflect. Play along in the goofy games. Take the mental and emotional space to use this session to create positive change. 

**Have Integrity** - When we make commitments, we follow through. When we can’t, we use it as an opportunity for growth. 
We are human, we all make mistakes. We ask for help when we need it, and provide help when asked.

**Give and Receive Honest Feedback** - Being part of another’s process is a privilege. Listen. Get consent to give feedback. Affirm what works first. Identify what didn’t work and possible solutions in the future. Acknowledge feedback when you receive it, share when you incorporate it.

**Make Connections** - Connect with people. Connect ideas. Build bridges for your peers with your experiences.

**It Should Be Hard** - Sometimes to think outside the box, sometimes to take critique, and sometimes to get along
with our peers. We try to get comfortable with ambiguity, risk, and reflection.
