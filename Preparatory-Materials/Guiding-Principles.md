# Our Guiding Principles

**Get Started** - Maybe it doesn’t make sense yet or it seems silly. We have to start everything somewhere. 
Nothing will be perfect at the beginning. We learn from what doesn’t work.

**Make Thinking Loud** - We learn more from another’s process than another’s product. Share not only conclusions, 
but the reasoning behind them. Share the ‘why’. 

**Don't Be Mean** - This is our network, here for a shared purpose. Recognize that out of the many, many different 
paths we all took here, we’re now present in a common moment, wanting to learn. Toxic behavior travels fast and negatively affects everyone. 

**Be Twice as Excited** - Moments of excitement and open positivity can feel like vulnerability. It takes greater strength to 
lean in with enthusiasm than to disengage. Other people will get excited if you are excited about what you are doing.

**Commit to It** - Read to the end of emails. Take the time to do the pre-session work and the post-session surveys. 
Play along in the goofy games. Take the mental and emotional space to use this session to create positive change. 

**Have Integrity** - When we make commitments, we follow through. When we can’t, we use it as an opportunity for growth. 
We are human. We all make mistakes. We ask for help when we need it, and provide help when asked.

**Give and Receive Honest Feedback** - Being part of another’s process is a privilege. Listen. Be reflective, not reactive. 
Get consent to give feedback. Affirm what works. Make it a dialogue not a monologue. Target behaviors not people. Identify what didn’t work and possible solutions in the future. Acknowledge the feedback. Share when you incorporate it.

**Make Connections** - Connect with people. Connect ideas. Connect experiences. 

**It Should Be Hard** - Sometimes to think outside the box, sometimes to take critique, and sometimes to get along
with our peers. We try to get comfortable with ambiguity, risk, and reflection.
