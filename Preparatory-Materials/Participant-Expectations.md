# Career Readiness Program Participant Expectations

The CaRe Program will take us through active, intense sessions, full of information and opportunities to grow. 
In order to do that effectively and efficiently, we have a couple of expectations for participants, and some 
they can have for us. 

## What we expect from you:
- **Be fully present each session - on time, participating, and focused**

  - We value our time with you, and want you to be there to support your peers. That means:
    - Show up on time, every single session. 
    - Minimize tech use unrelated to what we’re doing, and participate in the activities with the whole group.

- **Complete requested pre-session activities or other deliverables**
   
  - A lot of us don’t like homework, but sometimes a session requires information that needs to be collected before we come together as a group or after we’ve met. This includes:
    - Pre-session activities or deliverables
    - Post-session surveys 
    - Post-program surveys
    
- **Communicate with us**

  - We use Slack and email to communicate. We expect:
    - That everyone responds to messages in a timely manner (You can expect that of us, too!) 
    - That messages in Slack stay appropriate (PG) and on-topic for any given channel. 
    - That participants let us know as soon as possible if they can’t make a session, complete pre-session deliverables, or are going to be late. 

- **Be willing to mess up**

  - We’re going to ask you to try out things that may be totally new to you, and we ask that you take those risks bravely. Failure is just an opportunity to learn and try again in a new way.

## What you can expect from your Program Coordinators, Facilitators, and WiTNY:

**Full attention and engagement in your success in this program**

- We are here for you.  You can expect that we will be responsive to emails and inquiries, supportive of your goals to the best of our ability, and consistent in our messaging and intent.

**Maintain open lines of communication and support**

- We aim to affirm first in moments of challenge, to validate your lived experiences, and to be a resource and an ear when you need assistance. We will ask you for feedback and ask for your input as we work to do a better job supporting your goals. 

**Challenge you to think and go further.**

- We are going to push you to be braver, to take risks, to see yourself in your best light. We will ask you to put yourself in situations just uncomfortable enough to catalyze growth, and be there to encourage you to take advantage of those opportunities.
