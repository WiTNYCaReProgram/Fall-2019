# Pre-Program Checklist

We get a very limited amount of time to cover a lot of things, so we ask that you do some review of our documentation and a little work up front before your first session. (Don’t worry, it’s not hard. We promise!) 

Prior to arriving for Week 1, please make sure you have completed the following list:

- [ ] Read through our [Program Overview;](../2_Program-Overview.md)

- [ ] Take our Pre-Program Survey, available at: https://airtable.com/shrx2dihBLxmfGD7A 

- [ ] Consider our [Guiding Principles;](3_Guiding-Principles.md) 

- [ ] Get to know our [Participant Expectations;](4_Participant-Expectations.md)

- [ ] Get familiar with our [program tools](5_Course-Tools.md), including Slack and LinkedIn;

- [ ] Start thinking about what you want to get from this semester’s CaRe program, and where you want to be when it’s over with
our [CaRe Goal Worksheet](6_CaRe-Goal-Development.md)
